## Summary

Cybersecurity Specialist and Offensive Security Consultant with 25+ years of IT experience across systems, networking, and security.
OSCP (2025), HTB CPTS and CWES certified, with hands-on expertise in penetration testing, red teaming, and adversary simulation.
Ranked “Pro Hacker” on Hack The Box, with practical experience compromising numerous machines and publishing professional pentest-style
reports in the Reports section of my website.

Previously led enterprise IT operations at ACTOM (Pty) Ltd, including Active Directory deployments for 500+ users, enterprise security audits,
and group-wide infrastructure projects. This dual background in IT management and offensive security enables me to bridge the gap between
defense and attack—identifying vulnerabilities while understanding their operational and business impact.

strengthen their security posture.
